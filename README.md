## Description

* This project reads in JSON restaurant data and plots the data either on a map or displays it on a page. This is for restaurants in New York City.

## Project Instructions

This project uses a service worker to cache information so that a site is accessible offline. The project was also made responsive and accessability components like ARIA and alt tags were included. 

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you have some options:

1. Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:bld2104/udacity-fend-restaurant-project.git
    ```

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
